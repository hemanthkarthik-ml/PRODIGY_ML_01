# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
I built a linear regression model to predict house prices based on key features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
- **Features used:**
  - `GrLivArea` (Above ground living area in square feet)
  - `BedroomAbvGr` (Number of bedrooms above ground)
  - `FullBath` (Number of full bathrooms)
- **Target:** `SalePrice` (House sale price)

## ✅ Project Highlights
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Selected relevant features for simple regression
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluated the model using metrics like:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
